PHP MVC Boilerplate
===================

PHP MVC Boilerplate is a very basic and lightweight 
MVC framework.

### Setup

To see the project running add your database details 
in /config/config.php, upload to your server and call 
yoursite.com/install.php. This will setup the example 
tables in your database.

Disclaimer: This is a framework for experimental/educational 
purposes only and is not intended for production use. There 
are many professional, community led frameworks out there. 
CakePHP being one.
